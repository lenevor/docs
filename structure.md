## Introduction

The default Lenevor application structure  is intended to provide excellent performance in creating applications large and small. However, you are free to organize your application however you want convenient. Lenevor does not impose restrictions on where a certain class is located, as long as it is registered from the `syscodes/register/autoloadClassmap.php` file or from Composer it can automatically load the class.

## The Root Directory

<a name="the-root-app-directory"></a>
### The App Directory

The `app` directory contains all the main code of your application. More later is explain with detail this directory; however,  all the classes in your application will be in this directory.

<a name="the-bootstrap-directory"></a>
### The Bootstrap Directory

The `bootstrap` directory contains the `app.php` file than bootstraps the framework. This directory also houses a `register` directory than contains framework generated files for autoload class map, files helpers and psr4. Therefore, you should not modify any files in this directory. 

<a name="the-config-directory"></a>
### The Config Directory

The `config` directory contains all of your application's configuration files. 

<a name="the-database-directory"></a>
### The Database Directory

The `database` directory contains your database migrations, seeds and allows you may also use the `data` sub-directory to hold an SQLite database.

<a name="the-public-directory"></a>
### The Public Directory

The `public` directory contains the `index.php` file, than is the entry point for all request entering you application and configures autloading. In this directory also houses your assets such as CSS, fonts, images and JavaScript.

<a name="the-resources-directory">
### The Resources Directory

The `resources` directory contains your views, as wll as your raw, un-compiled assets such as CSS and JavaScript. Also houses all of your language files.

<a name="the-routes-directory"></a>
### The Routes Directory

The `routes` directory contains all of the route definitoins for you application. By default, several route files are included with Laravel: `web.php` and `api.php`.

The `web.php` file contains routes that the `RouteServiceProvider` places in the `web` middleware group, which provides session state, CSRF protection, and cookie encryption. If your application does not offer a stateless RESTful API, perhaps all of its paths are defined in the `web.php` file.

The `api.php` file contains routes that the `RouteServiceProvider` places in the `api` middleware group. These routes are intended to be stateless, so requests entering the application through these routes are intended to be authenticated via tokens and will not have access to session state.

<a name="the-routes-directory"></a>
### The Storage Directory

The `storage` directory contains your logs, compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into `app`, `framework`, and `logs` directories. The `app` directory may be used to store any files generated by your application. The `framework` directory is used to store framework generated files and caches. Finally, the `logs` directory contains your application's log files.

<a name="the-vendor-directory"></a>
#### The Vendor Directory

The `vendor` directory contains your [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) dependencies.
